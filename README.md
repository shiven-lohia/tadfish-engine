# Tadfish Engine and GUI

Tadfish is an intermediate-level chess engine written in C++ with a Python-based GUI. It was developed as a coding project to explore core concepts in game tree search, evaluation heuristics, and C++ performance optimization.

---

## Features

* Roughly ~**1700-1800** elo based on testing against Stockfish
* C++ backend for efficient move generation and evaluation
* Python GUI using Tkinter and Pygame for interactive gameplay
* Chess.com-like sound effects and graphical feedback

### Engine Techniques

* **Negamax** framework for simplified recursive game tree search
* **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to eliminate unnecessary branches
* **Piece-Square Tables (PST)** for positional evaluation
* **Precomputed pseudo-legal move generation** for performance
* **Iterative Deepening** to allow time-based search depth
* **Aspiration Windows** to improve Alpha-Beta performance
* **Quiescent Search** to avoid horizon effect on volatile positions
* **Move Ordering** using **MVV-LVA** (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker)

### Game Modes

* Player vs Player
* Player vs Tadfish
* Tadfish vs Stockfish
* Tadfish vs Tadfish

---

## Upcoming Features

* Complete UCI support (Very high prioity)
* Opening book support (high priority)
* Transposition Tables (high priority)
* NNUE based evaluation (lower priority)
* Adjustable difficulty levels
* Game history and PGN export
* Timers for competitive play
* Ability to draw arrows in GUI by right clicking
* Dynamic evaluation bar in GUI

## How to Run

### 1. Compile the Engine (C++)

```bash
g++ -Iinclude src/*.cpp main.cpp -o tadfish
```

### 2. Run the GUI (Python)

Make sure you have `python-chess`, `pygame`, and `tkinter` installed. Run the corresponding python file for the gamemode you want to play.

```bash
# Example: Play against Tadfish
python player_vs_tadfish.py
```

---

## Known Drawbacks

* No opening theory
* Only supports one move outputs taking FEN as input, limited UCI support
* No multithreading or parallelism yet
* Lacks time control or search depth adjustments
* Sometimes prone to stalemate in winning positions while playing against itself
